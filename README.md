# Hurah logger
This small library contains the Logger class used in Hurah and the Novum Innovation app. I moved this to a separate 
library to reduce dependencies and unify the code that is used for Logging. Currently the class is just a wrapper for
Monolog and this code on it's own is not useful for anybody.
